# Environmental Forecasting

Welcome to the Environmental Forecasting Organisation, a community-led approach to building tools that can be used for forecasting within the environmental sciences. It's (only at present) an initiative started by The British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute.

## Libraries

* [download-toolbox](https://github.com/environmental-forecasting/download-toolbox): a general purpose download library that allows people to grab data from numerous common environmental endpoints, then pass these onto various downstream applications in a consistent form, with configurations.
* [preprocess-toolbox](https://github.com/environmental-forecasting/preprocess-toolbox): a general purpose preprocessing library that ingests datasets and creates a parseable structure
* [model-ensembler](https://github.com/environmental-forecasting/model-ensembler): a "low profile" (it doesn't need complex runners or installation beyond a python environment) for running batches of workflows on HPCs. Used for data and process models extensively in BAS projects.

## Pipeline Overview

Soon will be coming an explanation of the concept of a pipeline and how these tools can help you build one. Watch this space!
